# Framework

Use the [DORA Research Program](assets/dora_research_program.pdf) to frame the story of how I
learned R and software engineering by implementing the DORA DevOps technical practices:

- [Version Control](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-tech-version-control)
- [Trunk-based Development](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-trunk-based-development)
- [Shifting Left on Security](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-shifting-left-on-security)
- [Continuous Integration](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-continuous-integration)
- [Continuous Testing](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-test-automation)
- [Deployment Automation](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-deployment-automation)
- [Code Maintainability](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-code-maintainability)
  (also cover "clean" code)
