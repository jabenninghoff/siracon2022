# Framework

Use the [DORA Research Program](assets/dora_research_program.pdf) to frame the story of how I
learned R and software engineering by implementing the DORA DevOps technical practices:

- [Version Control](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-tech-version-control)
- [Trunk-based Development](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-trunk-based-development)
- [Shifting Left on Security](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-shifting-left-on-security)
- [Continuous Integration](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-continuous-integration)
- [Continuous Testing](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-test-automation)
- [Deployment Automation](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-deployment-automation)
- [Code Maintainability](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-code-maintainability)
  (also cover "clean" code)

# Timeline

Create a timeline of my journey using [vistime](https://shosaco.github.io/vistime/) or
[timevis](https://daattali.com/shiny/timevis-demo/).

# Data

Use GitHub data to show how the DORA metrics changed over time as I developed and used
[rdev](https://jabenninghoff.github.io/rdev/).

## git log

Idea: use `gert::git_log()` tables across all my public and personal (private) R repositories over time to create an
annotated timeline and visualization of my work, and implementation of the DORA technical practices.

Import git logs from my repositories:

```{r git_logs}
my_gitlogs <- map_dfr(
  c("jbplot", "rdev", "rstudio-training", "rtraining", "siracon2022", "software-resilience", "workshop7"),
  ~ mutate(git_log(repo = paste0("../../", .x), max = .Machine$integer.max), repo = .x, .before = "commit")
) |>
  arrange(time)
```

Filter logs by repository, adding cutoff dates when active development ended for timeline visualization.

```{r filtered_gitlogs}
filtered_gitlogs <- my_gitlogs |>
  filter(!(repo == "rstudio-training" & time > ymd_h("2020-12-29 0"))) |>
  filter(!(repo == "software-resilience" & time > ymd_h("2021-02-22 0"))) |>
  filter(!(repo == "rtraining" & time > ymd_h("2021-10-08 0"))) |>
  filter(!(repo == "workshop7" & time > ymd_h("2021-12-07 0"))) |>
  filter(!(repo == "jbplot" & time > ymd_h("2022-02-07 0"))) |>
  mutate(repo = factor(repo, levels = c(
    "rstudio-training", "software-resilience", "rtraining", "rdev", "workshop7", "jbplot", "siracon2022"
  )))
```

Plot monthly commits by repository.

```{r plot_gitlogs}
filtered_gitlogs |>
  mutate(time = floor_date(time, unit = "month")) |>
  group_by(time, repo) |>
  summarize(commits = n(), .groups = "drop") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = commits, color = repo)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  theme_quo()
```

## Timeline

Create a timeline using groups showing the history of the repositories:

* training: rstudio-training, rtraining, "Working with R"
* development: rdev, jbplot
* notebooks: software-resilience, workshop7, siracon2022

## Releases

Plot releases over time: total GitHub releases per period (for all repositories) to show changes in release frequency.
